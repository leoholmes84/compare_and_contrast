A persuasive essay should start with a clear thesis statement. A strong thesis statement will inform the audience about the topic and your position on a particular issue. It should also set the stage for the rest of the essay. In addition, it should be supported with facts and evidence to convince the reader.

The body paragraphs should be grouped according to their topic. Each topic sentence needs at least four sentences of material. It is also advisable to use grouping notes to provide supporting details for each point. In addition, the first body paragraph should state the most important point, while the second paragraph should present the second best point. The final paragraph should end with a call-to-action.
